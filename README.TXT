In this Android project I design a simple Distributed Hash Table based on Chord for multiple android devices sending messages among themselves.

There are specifically three things that I have implemented: 
  1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning
  2) Ring-based routing
  3) Node joins

Steps Taken:
  1) Writing the Content Provider
  2) Writing the Main Activity

Other Files:
  1) Create AVDs -
  2) Run AVDs -
  3) Establish Connection - 
  4) Test application -
